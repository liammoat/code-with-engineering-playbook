## Practices

### Testing

> Liam's brain dump: Write tests that verify the functionality, quality, and performance of your code. Use a testing framework or tool that supports automated, repeatable, and isolated testing. Write unit tests that test each function or module in isolation, and integration tests that test the interactions and dependencies between different parts of your system. Write test cases that cover both the normal and the edge cases, and use descriptive and meaningful names for your tests. Use code coverage tools to measure how much of your code is tested, and aim for a high percentage of coverage. For example, use JUnit, PyTest, or Mocha, depending on your language and preferences, and write tests that follow the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert.
