# Code Quality

*Code Quality* is a overarching term that encompasses a number of patterns and practices that are designed to help ensure that the code we write is elegant, efficient, and simple. It should be easy to read, without duplications, and written with care. While often subjective, there are a number of patterns and practices that are generally accepted as good practice.
